Play the thirteen card game with bots

A card game called Thirteen where there are four players and each player has 13 cards each. The goal is to get rid of the cards before the other players. It is similar to poker where there are different hands that have different strengths. The bot AI is not that great right now but I will definitely make improvements to the AI to where they will play the most optimal hand possible. I know it is a lot of code and I will refactor the code in the future. This is a pretty complex game if you really think about it, how the player decides which hand to play next is kind of like chess. Here is what I will improve: 1. make the AI a lot better 2. Add a scoreboard that keeps track of how many times each player got first, second, third, and fourth place. You can play the game here: https://thirteencardgame.000webhostapp.com/
